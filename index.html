            <div class="para_1">
                Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World
                Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). This can include web design, web content development,
                client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting. web server and network security configuration, and
                e-commerce development. However, among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main
                non-design aspects of building web sites; writing markup and coding. Web development can range from
                developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet
                applications, electronic businesses, or social network services.

            <div class="label2"><strong>Web Development as an industry</strong></div>
            <div class="para_2">
                Since the mid-1990s, web development has been one of the fastest growing industries in the world. In
                1995 there were fewer than 1,000 web development companies in the United States, but by 2005 there were
                over 30,000 such companies[citation needed] in the U.S. alone. The growth of this industry is being
                pushed by large businesses wishing to sell products and services to their customers and to automate
                business workflow.

            <div class="label1"><strong>Security Considerations</strong></div>
            <div class="para_3">
                Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry error checking
                through forms, filtering output, and encryption.[1] Malicious practices such as SQL injection can be
                executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive knowledge of web development as a whole.
                Scripts can be exploited to grant unauthorized access to malicious users trying to collect information
                such as email addresses, passwords and protected content like credit card numbers.
